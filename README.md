# dart-midterm-output
Midterm project for my class CC 206 (App. Dev. and Emerging Technologies)

A classic game of Papel, Gunting, Bato! or Rock, Paper, Scissors in English using Dart in the terminal.

You can select a score to race to (3, 5, and 11) and you will choose either 
Papel, Gunting, or Bato and the computer will generate its own weapon as well.
Lastly, you can choose to play the game again if you want so you will no
longer have to launch the program again if it's still running.

P.S. Please ignore test.dart because it's just a place where I test code such as checking
syntax and the like.
